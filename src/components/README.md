## What are they
Components are React entities that serve only presentational purposes
and have no knowledge of the store or logic whatsoever

## Structure
1) Any components should be defined in their own **.jsx** files
2) Each file must be PascalCased ( i.e. MyTestContainer )
3) Instances of these classes must be CamelCased (i.e. myTestContainerInstance)
4) Each component must have an **export default <CONTAINER_NAME>** at the end
